    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>MCSP is a Non-Profit Organisation, registered with Department Of Social Development. It started on September2013, registered in 2014. Registration No. 139-985 NPO. The project is located at Mentz village, a rural village 30km east of Polokwane. It is about 4km drive off from R71 road. This area is very poor and so disadvantaged. It has no entertainment, less sports activities nor centre for performances. Because of that, young people have given up on education, now strongly on drugs and alcohol. Crime and teenage pregnancies are high in rate. Youth with lots of confidence, good personalities have lost hope. Their initiatives are wasted. Unemployment to graduates is very high in rate. Business seen around is for selling liquor. Our drop-in centre is a charity place where people may call casually for advice and assistance. It is recreational, educational and counselling services place. For our community to be a better place, we would like to stimulate the development of facilities that will allow appropriate education and training to be offered to all inhabitants, thereby empowering them to play a meaningful role in the economic and social life of the area.

        <h1>Mission and Visions</h1>
        <p>We established and stimulated the development of facilities- a community centre, that will allow appropriate education and training to be offered to all its inhabitants, with social activities for all :- children, OVC, youth, elderly, disabled, victims and women thereby empowering them to play a meaningful role in the economy and social life of the community. We influenced and encourage cooperation between all interested associations and organisations, to ensure that the resources and the new facilities are well managed in an appropriate, acceptable and sustainable manner. The services will create new jobs. To provide quality training, support, information, health services, career guidance, all identified and at specified area. To move from helplessness and poverty to self reliance and prosperity. To teach our youth about their culture and respect other people’s culture. To encourage people to do what they can, with what they have, where they are. To work towards a society that is free from violence and no drug usage.<br>
            Our vision is to see improvements of a good living standards in our community free from drugs. To see our youth performing in Tv’s screen showing their talents, unveiling it all. To see our people employed with good skills and certificates.<br>
